1. Forms in React.
2. Generally in HTML, forms do have their own state and updated automatically .
3. But in React mutable state is typically kept in state property of components and only updated with setState().
4. We can combine the two by making  the react state be the "Single Source of truth".
5. Then the react component that renders the form also constrols what happens in tha subsequent form. on subsequent user input.
6. Such component whose value os controlled by react is called *** Controlled Component ***
