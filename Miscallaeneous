1. Sessions:
    They are nothing but a way to store user information on mutliple requests.
    Suppose you want to add something to a shopping cart and then yiu switched back to some other page,
    In this case the ones addes in the shopping cart would be stored separately.
    So to store them only once and accross multiple requests, we use sessions.
