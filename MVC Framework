1. MVC stands for Models, Views, and Controllers.
2. We already know about models(collections), and views(front-end pages(ejs)).
3. Controllers contain the callbacks that we use in the router files.
4. Suppose listing.js(routes folder) which contains all the main routes about listings, has the index route which renders to index.ejs .
5. Now we have simply got the index page request and then we simply rendered the index.ejs page.
6. But that is the route which does not need to define the whole process of rendering and the changes or extracting the data there itself,
   So we make a controllers folder which segragates  this whole process in another file.
7. In the controllers folder, define those callbacks and then export them directly
8. In the listing.js file we now instead of defining the whole thing, just mention a callback of that method.

9. In listing.js file:
<!-- Index route
router.get("/", async (req,res) =>{
    const allListings = await Listing.find({});
    res.render("listings/index.ejs", {allListings});
}); -->

Copy this to controllers:
<!-- Index route
const Listing = require("../models/listing.js");
module.exports.index =  async (req,res) =>{
    const allListings = await Listing.find({});
    res.render("listings/index.ejs", {allListings});
}; -->

As simple as that

Now changes in the listing.js file:
<!-- const listingController = require("../routes/listing.js");
router.get("/", wrapAsync(listingController.index)); -->
Done!
